# Body Pulse

A modern web application that transforms InBody body composition scans into actionable health insights. Upload your scan, get instant analysis, and track your progress over time.

## What is Body Pulse?

Body Pulse helps you understand and track your body composition data from InBody scans. Instead of staring at numbers on a printout, you get:

- **Clear explanations** of what each metric means
- **Personalized insights** based on your results
- **Progress tracking** to see how your body composition changes over time
- **Easy comparisons** between scans to understand your journey

## Why This Exists

Traditional InBody reports show numbers, but they don't explain what those numbers mean or what you should do about them. Body Pulse bridges that gap by:

1. **Making data accessible** - Plain English explanations instead of medical jargon
2. **Providing context** - Understanding where you stand compared to healthy ranges
3. **Enabling action** - Actionable tips tailored to your specific results
4. **Tracking progress** - Visualize your journey and celebrate improvements

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Scan
Take a photo of your InBody scan or upload an image file. Our AI automatically extracts all the metrics.

### 2. Review & Confirm
Verify the extracted data and make any corrections if needed. Your information is stored securely.

### 3. Explore Your Dashboard
See your InBody Score, understand each metric, and get personalized recommendations for improvement.

### 4. Track Over Time
Compare scans side-by-side, view trends, and see how your body composition evolves.
